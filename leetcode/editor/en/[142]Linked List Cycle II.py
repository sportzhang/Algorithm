# Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cy
# cle, return null. 
# 
#  There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can 
# be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is 
# used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. N
# ote that pos is not passed as a parameter. 
# 
#  Notice that you should not modify the linked list. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
# Output: tail connects to node index 1
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the s
# econd node.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
# Output: tail connects to node index 0
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the f
# irst node.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [1], pos = -1
# Output: no cycle
# Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104]. 
#  -105 <= Node.val <= 105 
#  pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?
